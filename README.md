# YouTube Transcription (beta)

## Introduction
This repository houses a progam that can extract key details and the auto-generated transcriptions from youtube videos. It uses `BeautifulSoup` for the details and `youtube_transcript_api` for the transcriptions. (All which are found in the `requirements.txt`)

## Tutorial
It's rather easy!

### Installing Requirements

Make sure that you have all the modules installed from the `requirements.txt`

To do this, open up the `youtubetranscription` folder in your command prompt.
