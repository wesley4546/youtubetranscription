# YouTube Transcription

## Introduction
This repository houses a progam that can extract key details and the auto-generated transcriptions from youtube videos. It uses `BeautifulSoup` for the details and `youtube_transcript_api` for the transcriptions. (All which are found in the `requirements.txt`)

## Tutorial
It's rather easy!

 1) Run the `main.py` code in a python interactive console
 1) Enter in the YouTube URL
 1) It will return a `youtubevideo` object named `youtube_video` which you can then access the information from.


### `youtubevideo` class
The `youtubevideo` object has the following variable:
 * url (the video's URL)
 * title (title of video)
 * description (description of video)
 * views (number of views of video)
 * published (date of publication)
 * likes (likes of video)
 * dislikes (dislikes of video)
 * channel_name (name of channel)
 * channel_url (URL of channel from video)
 * channel_subscribers (number of subscribers)
 * transcription (auto-generated transcripts of video)
